Jacob's Funky Town North: Town of Funky Jakes	Jacob's Funky Town North is an oddly relaxing sight. Oddly relaxing because it is not the relaxing feeling one gets when sitting in a warm bath, but rather what one might experience when staring at something for so long, their vision blurs and their mind enters a state of dull calmness. The buildings and houses in this town all have some uncanny resemblance to one another. It is like looking at different sized versions of the same building all over the town: intriguingly cube-shaped, like Picasso's cubism taken from the canvas and transferred into a modern architecture, with giant windows and everything shades of blue. There is a coolness about this town. However, the buildings aren't the only things that have all been created to resemble each other; the inhabitants of this town also appear to be a population of identical units. They are tall, maybe almost seven feet. It's hard to say exactly, as their long slender limbs seem to exaggerate their height. Their hair, dark and sleek like a small waterfall upon each of their heads; they have eyes that portray a particular wanting of world dominance. They call themselves The Funky Jakes of Northside.

Jacob's Funky Town South: Town of Funky Jakes	Jacob's Funky Town South is almost an entirely different sight compared to the north side. While there is conformity among the buildings and inhabitants of Jacob's Funky Town North, the buildings in Jacob's Funky Town South are all very different in shape, colour and size. The inhabitants, however, are all still anatomically identical like those in the north end of town, but those who live on the south side have become known as the Jacob Smith rogues. They fight conformity, but each suffers from slight self resentment for looking the same as everyone else in the town. Many of the shops here sell clothing, and not a single shop carries the same clothing or even more than one piece of the same item. There is always a high demand for a new and unique fashion idea to keep things fresh.	Jacob's Funky Town North: Town of Funky Jakes,Zed Lepplin's Stairway	north,south	Weird Potion,Sexy Key

Dr. Bones' Wild Dungeon	The scent of rotting corpses could be smelled from outside the door, almost like a warning to stay away.  Now inside, the smell is worse, and there is an underlying scent of caramel.  The rotting corpses smell so rancid that any pleasantness or liking that caramel has ever brought you is now tainted.  Dead bodies can be seen just about everywhere.  They are piled, rotting in a corner, and even hanging from chains on the ceiling.  There is a skeleton-like figure in the corner hovering over something.  It is a large, steaming pot and the pot's contents now explain the putrid smell of this room.  Whoever that skeleton is, he is a freak and a maniac.  Who boils human flesh and flavours it with caramel???	Lambda-class T-4a Shuttle Route,Wet and Wild River	north,east	Weird Potion,Nuclear Bomb

Kuil Caves Depths	The cave is extremely dark, yet not entirely pitch black.  The walls have an interesting glimmer about them.  Every now and then, it almost looks like there is gold in the walls, and that is what ever so slightly illuminates the cave.  The monotonous dripping of water can be heard echoing throughout.  It is dank and at first, only the silhouettes of stalactite can be seen.  However, some dark objects can be seen scattered around the floor of the cave.

Zed Lepplin's Stairway	Zed Lepplinâ€™s Stairway contains over 10,000 stairs.  No one knows who built them, or if they were built from the ground up or from the sky down.  These stairs look sturdy, but no railings accompany the long way up. 	Jacob's Funky Town South: Town of Funky Jakes,Tyrael's Sky Realm	north,south
