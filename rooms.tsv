Jacob's Funky Town North: Town of Funky Jakes	Jacob's Funky Town North is an oddly relaxing sight. Oddly relaxing because it is not the relaxing feeling one gets when sitting in a warm bath, but rather what one might experience when staring at something for so long, their vision blurs and their mind enters a state of dull calmness. The buildings and houses in this town all have some uncanny resemblance to one another. It is like looking at different sized versions of the same building all over the town: intriguingly cube-shaped, like Picasso's cubism taken from the canvas and transferred into a modern architecture, with giant windows and everything shades of blue. There is a coolness about this town. However, the buildings aren't the only things that have all been created to resemble each other; the inhabitants of this town also appear to be a population of identical units. They are tall, maybe almost seven feet. It's hard to say exactly, as their long slender limbs seem to exaggerate their height. Their hair, dark and sleek like a small waterfall upon each of their heads; they have eyes that portray a particular wanting of world dominance. They call themselves The Funky Jakes of Northside.

Jacob's Funky Town South: Town of Funky Jakes	Jacob's Funky Town South is almost an entirely different sight compared to the north side. While there is conformity among the buildings and inhabitants of Jacob's Funky Town North, the buildings in Jacob's Funky Town South are all very different in shape, colour and size. The inhabitants, however, are all still anatomically identical like those in the north end of town, but those who live on the south side have become known as the Jacob Smith rogues. They fight conformity, but each suffers from slight self resentment for looking the same as everyone else in the town. Many of the shops here sell clothing, and not a single shop carries the same clothing or even more than one piece of the same item. There is always a high demand for a new and unique fashion idea to keep things fresh.	Jacob's Funky Town North: Town of Funky Jakes,Zed Lepplin's Stairway	north,south	Weird Potion,Sexy Key

Dr. Bones' Wild Dungeon	The scent of rotting corpses could be smelled from outside the door, almost like a warning to stay away.  Now inside, the smell is worse, and there is an underlying scent of caramel.  The rotting corpses smell so rancid that any pleasantness or liking that caramel has ever brought you is now tainted.  Dead bodies can be seen just about everywhere.  They are piled, rotting in a corner, and even hanging from chains on the ceiling.  There is a skeleton-like figure in the corner hovering over something.  It is a large, steaming pot and the pot's contents now explain the putrid smell of this room.  Whoever that skeleton is, he is a freak and a maniac.  Who boils human flesh and flavours it with caramel???	Lambda-class T-4a Shuttle Route,Wet and Wild River	north,east	Weird Potion,Nuclear Bomb
Tyrael's Sky Realm	It was Tyreal's stronghold. Since it was too high to reach, the stronghold was abondoned. One day, after someone built the Zed Lepplin's Stairway, people started to move in. Now it have become the second largest tour attraction. Yes, the largest one is Jacob's Funky Town.	Zed Lepplin's Stairway	north	Weird Potion,Baseball Bat

Goblins' Crazy Dungeon	Muffled shouts and curses can be heard from outside the door.  The handle is slimy, but the door opens easily.  It is brightly lit inside and the the cause for all the screaming becomes suddenly and oddly clear.  Goblins.  This room is full of goblins, and it looks like they have a strong interest in wrestlemania.  They wrestinnn	The Darkness,Goblins' Secret Tunnel	north,south	Weird Potion,Shield
Kuil Caves Depths	The cave is extremely dark, yet not entirely pitch black.  The walls have an interesting glimmer about them.  Every now and then, it almost looks like there is gold in the walls, and that is what ever so slightly illuminates the cave.  The monotonous dripping of water can be heard echoing throughout.  It is dank and at first, only the silhouettes of stalactite can be seen.  However, some dark objects can be seen scattered around the floor of the cave.

JakeMUD	You're currently logged in to JakeMUD, a lightweight MUD developed for UVic's Software Engineering 330 - Object Oriented Development. JakeMUD was developed by Keegan van der Laag, Jacob Smith, Christina Gee, Spencer Cox, and Todd Xu. Does it perfectly exemplify good object-oriented design practice? Well, err...no, not really. But it tries really hard, and that's what matters, right?	JakeMUD - Design	dennis
JakeMUD - Design	JakeMUD was originally designed to be lightweight and modular, so things like Rooms, Players, and Items are all instances of a base GameEntity class. Similarly, the Server class relies on owned helper objects of the TCPListener and TCPStream classes to make network traffic happen. This seemed like a good idea in theory, but in practice, the Server could probably use a redesign. More on that later. For now, let's all enjoy some of JakeMUD's SUPER-FUN commands!	JakeMUD - Implementation	dennis
JakeMUD - Implementation	JakeMUD is programmed entirely in C++. Well, I mean, I say that, but it's also using libevent for socket handling and asynchronous transport, and libevent is a C library, so at the very least, it wraps C functions into C++ classes. There are (at least) two additional threads present in JakeMUD: A thread for the TCPListener, and a thread for handling Message objects on the queue. These are implemented using std::thread, if anyone was wondering. Did we faithfully implement the beautiful object-oriented design we'd envisioned? Well, no. This is the first time most of us have programmed in C++, so we've been doing a lot of learning about code style. Ask me about the const keyword, I dare you.	JakeMUD - THE FUTURES	dennis
JakeMUD - THE FUTURES	What will JakeMUD become? What things are left to add? Well, first of all, we want to add items and an inventory system. Items are actually already implemented - there's one in this room, you just can't see it! After player inventories, we'd also like to implement NPCs, and a simple battle system. (I use the word "simple" to describe it, but let's be real: there's nothing simple about it.) Many a fortnight will be spent drinking (profusely) and coding as we bring JakeMUD soundly into the twentieth century, where it belongs.	Jacob's Funky Town North: Town of Funky Jakes	dennis
Zed Lepplin's Stairway	Zed Lepplinâ€™s Stairway contains over 10,000 stairs.  No one knows who built them, or if they were built from the ground up or from the sky down.  These stairs look sturdy, but no railings accompany the long way up. 	Jacob's Funky Town South: Town of Funky Jakes,Tyrael's Sky Realm	north,south
